This is my second time trying to build this little game as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s amazing curriculum.

#### It includes things like 

- Basic CSS Flexbox,
- Basic Vanilla js features like storing a value, comparing it to another value and evaluating the result,
- Some Sass,
- Light and dark theme options as well as listens to the OS default theme.
- As responsive as possible, potentially should work across a wide range of devices (hopefully).
